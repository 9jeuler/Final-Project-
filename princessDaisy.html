        <p class="description">Princess Daisy  is a fictional character in the Mario series of video games, in which she is the princess of the fictional region of Sarasaland. She first appeared in Super Mario Land as the game's damsel in distress, a role usually reserved for Princess Peach. Since her appearance in Mario Tennis, she has become a staple playable character in the Mario spin-off games, in which she is often paired up with Peach. It is often speculated that she is Luigi's love interest. Her official description for Mario Party 4 states that she and Luigi have a rumored love interest, more so from Luigi; but Waluigi likes her too, which she does not appreciate. Despite this, Daisy and Luigi have never been seen to interact in a romantic manner in the games. </p>

        <p class="description">Princess Daisy, or casually Daisy, is the princess of Sarasaland and a recurring character in the Mario franchise. She is a tomboy, something first stated in her debut appearance, Super Mario Land. In accompaniment to her name, she has an affinity for flowers. Her attire, special abilities, personal emblems, and general representations are often flowers, as well. While Daisy is from Sarasaland, she currently resides in the Mushroom Kingdom. After an early hiatus, Daisy was reintroduced in Mario Tennis for the Nintendo 64 when Nintendo suggested her to Camelot, the game's developers. As Camelot had difficulty finding suitable Mario characters for the real-life sport of tennis, they liked Nintendo's suggestion since she's a human character. Since then, Daisy has made recurring appearances as a playable character in most of the Mario spin-off games; including Mario Party, Mario Kart, and Mario sports titles.
