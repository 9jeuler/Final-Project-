        <p class="description">Mario is a fictional character in the Mario video game franchise, owned by Nintendo and created by Japanese video game designer Shigeru Miyamoto. Serving as the company's mascot and the eponymous protagonist of the series, Mario has appeared in over 200 video games since his creation. Depicted as a short, pudgy, Italian plumber who resides in the Mushroom Kingdom, his adventures generally center upon rescuing Princess Peach from the Koopa villain Bowser.</p>

        <p class="description">Every Power-Up is categorized in types; but only in side-scrollers. Here are the types in side-scrollers:
    Tiny - Mario's small, and can only take one hit before he croaks, giving him a great risk to die.
    Basic - Mario can take only two hits in sidescrollers, but can usually take more in the 3D titles. This is considered Mario's base form and sometimes called "Super Mario".
    Ability - Mario has mostly one ability here.
    Temporary - It's so great that it would be unfair or unbeatable if it isn't temporary. Use this item wisely.
    Suit - Mario has more than one ability, and the item needed is always a suit.
